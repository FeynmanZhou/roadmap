## List of feature/capabilities added with this release
For detailed notes on each of the individual repositories (NotaryProject, Notation and Notation-go-lib) users can refer to the individual release notes. In this document a summary view is provided.

### Notary V2 standard
The standard is still in draft stage. Based on community feedback some changes are expected to happen in upcoming alpha releases around signature format, revocation, and integration with external PKI and signing services.

### Notation CLI Client
Notation is a standalone client and is not integrated with Docker or Containerd client. It uses a fixed configuration scheme in this release, where the certificates for signing and verifying are kept in a file. Refer https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/blob/main/specs/notation-config.md. It supports the operations for sign and verify. 

To start using Notation Refer: https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/blob/main/hello-signing.md

### Notation Library
Written in the GO language the Library is currently focused  on enabling the Notation CLI.

## List of fixed issues
Not Applicable. This is the first release of the NotaryV2

## List of known/open issues
*This is not an exhaustive release. Users should refer to the Notary V2 roadmap at https://github.com/notaryproject/roadmap#readme for seeing the plan for subsequent releases*

1. The Alpha 1 release depends on [oras-artifacts-spec](https://github.com/oras-project/artifacts-spec/) registry support. See [getting started](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/blob/main/docs/hello-signing.md#getting-started) for using a local CNCF Distribution instance. Future versions will support OCI Distribution 1.0 based registries.
2. The current signature format is subject to change in subsequent alpha releases
3. Revocation support is not yet implemented



### Backwards Compatibility
While there is not a prior release, but this release is unlikely to be compatible   with the next release, and hence it should not be used in a production environment.
