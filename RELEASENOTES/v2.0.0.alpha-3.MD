## Goal of the release
- Notation client development.
    - Signature format (JWS) for signing and verification in RC-1.
    - Updates on use of plugins for signing and verification. Plugins let vendors and users integrate base Notation client with their choice of Key Vaults and PKI.
 - Update "Notation" (CLI client) implementation to match the latest specifications. With the new client, users can
    - Sign images with remote key stores that securely store the signing keys
    - Verify signatures using Trust stores configured in Notation clients
    - Sign images and Verify signatures with locally stored test keys/certificates for demonstration use only
    - Setup Trust stores with the new directory-based structure
    - Configure Trust Policy as a JSON document. Support for registry scope and signature verfication levels to customize the behaviour during verification.
    - Store signatures in registries compliant to the ORAS Reference spec [RC-1](https://github.com/oras-project/oras-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.2)

*We do not recommend this release for use in production environment. Refer release definitions [here](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/blob/main/RELEASE_MANAGEMENT.md). We suggest using it for testing and providing feedback to the Notary v2 working group only*

In this release of Notation command, the following CLI commands are supported. 
- notation sign

To start using Notation Refer: https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/blob/main/hello-signing.md

### Notation Library 
Written in the GO language the Library is divided up into two separate repos - [Notation-go](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go) and [Notation-core-go](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-core-go)

## Roadmap Guidance
*This is not an exhaustive list. Users should refer to the Notary v2 roadmap at https://github.com/notaryproject/roadmap#readme for seeing the plan for subsequent releases and refer to individual subprojects (repositories) releases notes for details*

1. The current signature format JWS is the proposed format for RC-1 release. Notary v2 community plans to support additional signature formats ( such as COSE)
2. Revocation support via Notation client will come in a future release
3. Alternate signature storage schemes which can use OCI Distribution 1.0 based registries is under investigation for a future release
