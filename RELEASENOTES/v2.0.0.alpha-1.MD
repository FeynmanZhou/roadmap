## List of feature/capabilities added with this release
For detailed notes on each of the individual repositories (NotaryProject, Notation and Notation-go-lib) users can refer to the individual release notes. A summary view is provided in this document.

### Notary V2 specifications
The draft specifications are included in this first release. Based on community feedback, updates are expected in the next alpha releases around signature format, revocation, integration with external PKI and signing services. 

### Notation CLI Client
Notation is a standalone client and is not integrated with Docker or Containerd clients. It uses a fixed configuration scheme in this release, where the certificates for signing and verifying are kept in a file. Refer https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/blob/main/specs/notation-config.md. It supports the operations for signing and verifying artifacts. This release depends on [oras-artifacts-spec](https://github.com/oras-project/artifacts-spec/) registry support for storing signatures. See [getting started](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/blob/main/docs/hello-signing.md#getting-started) for using a local CNCF Distribution instance. 

To start using Notation Refer: https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/blob/main/hello-signing.md

### Notation Library
Written in the GO language the Library is currently focused on enabling the Notation CLI.
