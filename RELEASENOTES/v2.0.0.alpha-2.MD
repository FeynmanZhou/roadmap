## List of feature/capabilities added with this release
For detailed notes on each of the individual repositories (NotaryProject, Notation and Notation-go-lib) users can refer to the individual release notes. A summary view is provided in this document.

### Notary V2 specifications
Defined Trust Policy, Trust Store,  Signature Verification and Signing workflows along with extensibility mechanisms via Notation plugins.

### Notation CLI Client
*(Unchanged from previous release)*
Notation is a standalone client and is not integrated with Docker or Containerd clients. It uses a fixed configuration scheme in this release, where the certificates for signing and verifying are specified in a file. Refer https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/blob/main/specs/notation-config.md. It supports the operations for signing and verifying artifacts. This release depends on [oras-artifacts-spec](https://github.com/oras-project/artifacts-spec/) registry support for storing signatures. See [getting started](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/blob/main/docs/hello-signing.md#getting-started) for using a local CNCF Distribution instance. 

To start using Notation Refer: https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/blob/main/hello-signing.md

### Notation Library 
*(Unchanged from previous release)*
Written in the GO language the Library is currently focused on enabling the Notation CLI.

## List of fixed issues
Refer individual release notes.

## Roadmap Guidance
*This is not an exhaustive list. Users should refer to the Notary V2 roadmap at https://github.com/notaryproject/roadmap#readme for seeing the plan for subsequent releases and refer to individual subprojects (repositories) releases notes for details*

1. The current signature format is subject to change in upcoming release
2. Revocation support is planned for an upcoming release
3. Alternate signature storage schemes which can use OCI Distribution 1.0 based registries is under investigation for a future release

### Backwards Compatibility
The Notation client has not changed from the alpha-1 release.
